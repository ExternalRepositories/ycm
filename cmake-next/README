The files in this folder and its subfolder come from CMake git
repository:

  git://cmake.org/cmake.git

These files were imported exactly as they are on the original
repository, in order to have the new features and bugfix available in
newer releases with older cmake releases.

                      DO NOT MODIFY OR FORK THEM!

If you find a bug or need a new feature in one of those files, please
consider fixing them upstream and importing the latest revision of the
file when your patch is merged.

To refresh the files, update cmake repository (in ${CMAKE_DIR} folder)
and run from this directory:

  for file in `find . -type f | grep -v "README\|CMakeLists.txt"`; do cp ${CMAKE_DIR}/${file} ./${file}; done

Then update this file with:

  sed -i "s/\(^Latest imported commit:\)  [0-9a-f]\+$/\1  `cd ${CMAKE_DIR}; git rev-parse HEAD`/g" README

Latest imported commit:  6d1444feacb1c2d621b776ac61412f92ff0a1c34
